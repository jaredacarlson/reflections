When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You would want to use a remote repository when you are sharing code or collaborating on a project with other people.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I may want to experiment with changes or keep my local repository at a specific
version in which case having Git automatically pull changes would thwart those
efforts.
