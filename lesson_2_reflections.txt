What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository a hidden folder named .git is created in
the main directory.  This folder contains meta data about all the changes made
to files that are being tracked within the repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary place that you can take a file out of the
working directory and place it before you commit it to the local repository
to be tracked. It allows you to choose one-by-one the files you want to place
in the repository without having to place all of the contents of the working
directory in the repository.
